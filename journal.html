<div id="entry1" class="entries"> ENTRY 1 (9/29/25): This is my first journal entry in CS 1. So far I have made a couple projects, and played around with animation. My first piece of code was a block that basically was a cat meme. My second project was working with animation, and trying to get a penguin moving across stage, waddling. I could definately do better. Today I am really working on my journal, as is evident by this heinous entry. Over and out.</div>

<div id="entry2" class="entries"> ENTRY 2 (10/30/25): This is my second journal entry in CS 1. GitHub finally has accepted me, and my website it published (even if its a 404). Of course I will edit my website to make it look better in the future. Ahem, the far future. Or not, who knows? :) Over and out.</div>
