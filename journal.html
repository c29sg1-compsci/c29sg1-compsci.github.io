<div id="entry1" class="entries"> ENTRY 1 (9/29/25): This is my first journal entry in CS 1. So far I have made a couple projects, and played around with animation. My first piece of code was a block that basically was a cat meme. My second project was working with animation, and trying to get a penguin moving across stage, waddling. I could definately do better. Today I am really working on my journal, as is evident by this heinous entry. Over and out.</div>
<br>
<br>
<div id="entry2" class="entries"> ENTRY 2 (10/30/25): This is my second journal entry in CS 1. GitHub finally has accepted me, and my website it published (even if its a 404). Of course I will edit my website to make it look better in the future. Ahem, the far future. Or not, who knows? :) Over and out.</div>
<br>
<br>
<div id="entry3" class="entries"> ENTRY 3 (11/6/25): This is my third journal entry in CS 1. Last class we started playing with some javascript, and for no apparent reason I have automatically reverted to making the cat meme thing. It stopped being funny a while ago. Also, I learned how to update my website, like how this journal entry will sync up to github. Welp. I think that's it? I'll try to work on my website more in my free time. It's a great procrastination tool y'know. Bye! I mean... Over and out.</div>
<br>
<br>
<div id="entry4" class="entries"> ENTRY 4 (12/4/25): I haven't written a journal entry in a pretty long time so here's what's what: I have an idea to make a page on my website that is a bookshelf, and when you press each book, it'll be a scene from that. For example, for the hunger games, I want to have the user put in their name and then my drawings say "_____ is the tribute" or something like that. And from winnie the pooh it would be them walking together and wobbling and stuff and when you clicked on each of them they would say a famous quote, like "sometimes I sits and thinks and sometimes I just sits". This would be a lot of fun I think. I could even have hyperbole and a half and put in one of her jokes? idk. But this could be really funny if I put in a bunch of memes from books, idk. The additions I've added to the website have mostly been with javascript. Bye! </div>
